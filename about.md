# Vision

A world in which access to higher education is a given and not a privilege.

# Mission Statement

At the Iron Legacy Foundation, we are dedicated to empowering underprivileged students in their pursuit of higher education. By investing in the youth of our community and promoting equity, we aim to break cycles of disadvantage and create pathways to brighter, more successful futures.

# Organization History

In 2022, Co-Founders Luis and Angel worked alongside La Puente Mutual Aid to find a way to give back to the community. A simple text message snowballed into a fully-fledged scholarship. Fast forward three years later, the team has more than tripled, become an official 501(c)(3), and has provided six scholarships to underprivileged seniors going to Stanford, UCLA, Cal State LA, Cal Poly Pomona, and MT. Sac.

# The Future

Starting in 2025, the team is exploring ways to enhance and strategize the original La Puente Community Scholarship while also developing a new scholarship aligned with its mission. Additionally, the team is beginning research and grant writing efforts to collaborate with the city and bring about meaningful change in the community.
