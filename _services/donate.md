Iron Legacy believes that struggle and hardship are the raw materials that forge steel. 

Every year we work to provide highschool students of the La Puente community with scholarships to support their pursuit of higher education. All donations go directly to scholarship donation pool. We appreciate all donors and thank you for helping these students in the next major chapter of their lives.
